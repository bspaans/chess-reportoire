# Petrov; Classical; main line (for Black)

## 1. e4 e5

### 2. Nf3 Nf6

#### 3. Nxe5 d6

White accepts the gambit and is temporarily up a pawn.

##### 4. Nf3 Nxe4

Black recaptures the pawn. White has many possible options now. 

###### 5. d4 d5

White gains space and opens up the bishop, but Black can cement its horsy.

###### 6. Bd3 Bd6

White puts pressure on the knight, and Black has a number of valid options 
here. We also explore `6. Be3 Nc6` below, but in this line we just make room 
to castle and take control of some nice diagonals.

###### 6. Bd3 Nc6

White puts pressure on the knight, but it doesn't really do much yet. 
Black develops their knight, attacks the pawn on d4, and gets ready 
to put White's knight in a pin.

###### 7. O-O Be7

White castles and Black makes sure it doesn't get into any nasty pins, when 
White's rook comes to `e1`.

###### 8. Re1 Bg4

The rook comes to `e1` anyway, and Black says: you can win my `d` pawn, but
I'll also win your `d` pawn, because your knight is now pinned.

###### 9. c4 Bxf3

It's all coming tumbling down now and Black needs to resolve some of the
tension, starting by capturing and moving its knight back to `f6`.

###### 5. Qe2 Qe7

White pins the knight to the king, and `Qe7` is pretty much forced as 
defending the knight with a pawn would run into `d3`.

###### 6. Nc3 Nxc3

Attacking the knight again, but now we can just take it and give White 
doubled pawns.

###### 6. d3

White plays `d3` anyway and offers a queen exchange.

###### 5. Bd3
