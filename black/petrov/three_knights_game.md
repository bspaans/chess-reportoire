# Petrov; Three Knights Game (for Black)

## 1. e4 e5

### 2. Nf3 Nf6

#### 3. Nc3 Nc6

White declines the free pawn, and protects its own. As Black we can now play a
kind of reverse Italian with `Bc5`, which can be a fun line, but hangs the pawn
on `e5`. At lower levels people tend to move the bishop and not take the pawn
though; after which Black has a fairly comfortable game. Other options are kind
of passive maybe (`Nc6`, `Bb4`, `d6`, `Bd6`).

`Nc6` transposes into a four knights opening, which has a reputation of being
drawish, but then again, we're playing Black so we're doing okay. The onus is
on White.
