# The Petrov or Russian Defense (for Black)

## 1. e4 e5

### 2. Nf3 Nf6

#### 3. Be2 Nc6

White gets ready to castle, but is slightly passive. On the other hand,
grabbing the pawn would give Black a massive disadvantage in development.
After castling white has moved 5 pieces and pawns, whilst black has only moved
2.
