# Petrov; Urusov Gambit (for Black)

## 1. e4 e5

### 2. Nf3 Nf6

#### 3. Bc4 Nxe4

White gets ready to castle and tries to play like it's an Italian, but this
line is worse than `3. Be2`. You do run into this quite a bit though, because 
it's the Italian, remember?

If Black ever sacrifices its bishop on `f7`, it's usually safe to take. The 
king should not move up the board after `Nxe5`, but find a safe spot on `g8`.

##### 4. d3 

##### 4. Nxe5

##### 4. Nc3 Nxc3

Somehow see this quite a bit.

###### 5. dxc3 f6

White recaptures the knight, but has given themselves doubled pawns. They have 
also opened up the queen's file, which has made `d5` an interesting target. We 
definitely don't want to allow the knight to come in and also target `f7` so 
`f6` needs to be played.


###### 5. bxc3
