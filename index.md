# Chess reportoire

Personal notes on my chess openings, going into hopefully reasonable middle
games or completely winning traps. Trying to talk about best engine lines and
mainline responses first.

# White Pieces

White opens with `1. e4`. Best by test.

## 1. e4 e5

[Open Game](white/open.md).

## 1. e4 c5

[The Sicilian](white/sicilian.md).

## 1. e4 e6

[The French Defense](white/french.md).

## 1. e4 c6

[Caro Kann](white/caro_kann.md).

## 1. e4 d6

[The Pirc Defense](white/pirc.md).

## 1. e4 g6

It's some modern stuff.

## 1. e4 Nf6

## 1. e4 Nc6

# Black Pieces

## 1. e4 e5

Just a classic

### 2. Nf3 Nf6

The Petrov or Russian defense.

#### 3. Nxe5 d6

White accepts the gambit and is temporarily up a pawn.

##### 4. Nf3 Nxe4

Black recaptures the pawn. White has many possible options now. 

###### 5. d4 d5

White gains space and opens up the bishop, but Black can cement its horsy.

###### 6. Be3 Bd6

White puts pressure on the knight, and Black has a number of valid options 
here. We also explore `6. Be3 Nc6` below, but in this line we just make room 
to castle and take control of some nice diagonals.

###### 6. Be3 Nc6

White puts pressure on the knight, but it doesn't really do much yet. 
Black develops their knight, attacks the pawn on d4, and gets ready 
to put White's knight in a pin.

###### 7. O-O Be7

White castles and Black makes sure it doesn't get into any nasty pins, when 
White's rook comes to `e1`.

###### 8. Re1 Bg4

The rook comes to `e1` anyway, and Black says: you can win my `d` pawn, but
I'll also win your `d` pawn, because your knight is now pinned.

###### 9. c4 Bxf3

It's all coming tumbling down now and Black needs to resolve some of the
tension, starting by capturing and moving its knight back to `f6`.

###### 5. Qe2 Qe7

White pins the knight to the king, and `Qe7` is pretty much forced as 
defending the knight with a pawn would run into `d3`.

###### 6. Nc3 Nxc3

Attacking the knight again, but now we can just take it and give White 
doubled pawns.

###### 6. d3

White plays `d3` anyway and offers a queen exchange.

###### 5. Bd3

##### 4. Nd3 Nxe4

Black recaptures the pawn. 

##### 4. Nc4

##### 4. Nxf7 Kxf7

#### 3. Nc3 Nc6

White declines the free pawn, and protects its own. As Black we can now play a
kind of reverse Italian with `Bc5`, which can be a fun line, but hangs the pawn
on `e5`. At lower levels people tend to move the bishop and not take the pawn
though; after which Black has a fairly comfortable game. Other options are kind
of passive maybe (`Nc6`, `Bb4`, `d6`, `Bd6`).

`Nc6` transposes into a four knights opening, which has a reputation of being
drawish, but then again, we're playing Black so we're doing okay. The onus is
on White.

#### 3. d4 Nxe4

White declines the free pawn and tries to grab space in the centre.

#### 3. Be2

White gets ready to castle, but is slightly passive.

#### 3. Bc4 Nxe4

White gets ready to castle and tries to play like it's an Italian, but this
line is worse than `3. Be2`. You do run into this quite a bit though, because 
it's the Italian, remember?

If Black ever sacrifices its bishop on `f7`, it's usually safe to take. The 
king should not move up the board after `Nxe5`, but find a safe spot on `g8`.

##### 4. d3 

##### 4. Nxe5

##### 4. Nc3 Nxc3

Somehow see this quite a bit.

###### 5. dxc3 f6

White recaptures the knight, but has given themselves doubled pawns. They have 
also opened up the queen's file, which has made `d5` an interesting target. We 
definitely don't want to allow the knight to come in and also target `f7` so 
`f6` needs to be played.


###### 5. bxc3

#### 3. Bd3 d5

Bad move by white. Blocks the other bishop, and actually loses the light
squared bishop after `d5`.

##### 4. exd5 e4 ; 5. Bxe4 Nxe4 ; 6. Qe2 Qe7

##### 4. Qe2 dxe4 ; 5. Bxe4 Nxe4 ; 6. Qxe4 Nc6


### 2. Nc3 Nf6

## 1. d4 f5

The Dutch. Learning this is kind of a work in progress, but hopefully this
document will help with that. The King's Indian Defense

## 1. c4 f5

The Anglo-Dutch

## 1. Nc3

## 1. Nf3

## 1. g3

## 1. b3
