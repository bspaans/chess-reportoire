# Chess reportoire

Personal notes on my chess openings, trying to organise my minimal knowledge
and thoughts. The lines below provide a reportoire that hopefully lead into
reasonable middle games or completely winning traps. Trying to talk about best
engine lines and mainline responses first, and adding lines that you'll often 
see in play.

White opens with `1. e4`. Best by test.
