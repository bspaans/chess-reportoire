# Italian Opening; Two Knights Defense (for White)

## 1. e4 e5

### 2. Nf3 Nc6

#### 3. Bc4 Nc6

Black develops his knight and attacks the pawn on `e4`. However this does allow
White to attack the pawn on `f7` by playing `4. Ng5`, which is called the fried
liver attack for some reason.  Things get complicated fast so you need to be
prepared when you play this line, but it's effective especially at the lower
levels and a surprisingly rich position.

The mainline goes `4. d3`, but I like playing the fried liver.

##### 4. Ng5 d5 ; 5. exd5 Na5

Trying to kick away the bishop, but at the same time opening a diagonal to the king.
White plays `6. Bb5+`

###### 6. Bb5+ c6 ; 7. dxc6 bxc6

Blocking the check twice in a row, and now we're at the point where engines
disagree.  White can play `8. Qf3` pinning the pawn to the rook, or White can
move its bishop back `8. Bd3`.

I prefer following with `8. Qf3`, because it's hard for Black to find the right
move if they're not familiar with this line. 

NB. Need to check this in stockfish >8

###### 8. Qf3 Be7

Getting ready to castle. 

###### 8. Qf3 cxb5

Saccing the exchange, but maybe not intended. White responds with `9. Qxa8`.
It's important for White not to get to greedy after this, because Black will
gain a lot of tempo if the pawn on `a7` is captured.

###### 8. Qf3 Rb8

Never seen this move, but `9. Be2` seems like a fair response.

###### 6. Bb5+ Be7 ; 7. Qe2 Be7 

Black defends by blocking with their bishop. We don't want to hamper our development 
by capturing, so White defends by moving the queen to `e2`. Note that after `Be7` the pawn 
on `d5` is hanging. Candidate moves `Bxd7` and `c4`, or `Nc3`.

##### 4. Ng5 d5 ; 5. exd5 Nb4 

The Kloss Gambit. A pretty solid, almost equalising move. Attacking `d5` and kind of taking 
the wind out of White's sails. Always disappointed to see this. 

The move for White here is to play `6. d6`. The pawn is lost, but the threat on
`f7` can be renewed.

###### 6. d6 Nbd5

Not interested in taking the pawn, Black blocks the diagonal altogether. 
This does allow White to play `7. dxc7`.

###### 7. dxc7 Qxc7

Black recaptures the pawn and attacks the bishop. White's best move here is to 
play `8. d3` to defend the bishop and the knight at the same time.

###### 6. d6 cxd6 ; 7. Bxf7+ Ke7 ; 8. Bb3

A blunder. White plays `7. Bxf7+` and `Ke7` is forced. After the bishop retreats 
White has a comfortable position.

###### 6. d6 Nfd5

Not interested in taking the pawn, but also unleashing the queen on the knight
on `g5`. White defends with `7. d3` or `7. d4`, and even `7. Nxf7` seems playable.

##### 4. Ng5 d5 ; 5. exd5 b5 

Interesting counterplay. Black attacks the bishop on `c4`. The top move here 
is to play `6. Bf1` weirdly enough. But after `6 Bf1 Qxd4`, White wins a tempo 
with `7. Nc3` whilst keeping the pawn on `g2` defended, and attacking the 
pawn on `b4`

###### 6. Bf1 Qxd4 ; 7 Nc3 

Whereever the queen moves we can take on `b4` with the bishop. Unless the 
queen moves to a square the knight can attack from `b4` as that would win 
another tempo. After that we can get castled, play `d3` and develop the bishop

##### 4. Ng5 d5 ; 5. exd5 Nd4

Black moves its knight, but not to a stable outpost so White can play `6. c3`.
Black needs to either retreat the knight to the only safe square `f5`, or create 
a counter attack with `h6` or `b5`.

###### 6. c3 Nf5

The knight has retreated to a place where it's not really doing much, and all
its manaeouvring has left the pawn on `e5` undefended. So `7. Qe2` is a strong
move attacking the pawn, and Black has to defend with either `Nd6` or `Bd6`.
Everything else is weakening. `Qe7` works, but undefends `d5`. `Nd7` kind of
defends the pawn, but runs into `8. d4`.

###### 7. Qe2 Nd6

Black attacks the bishop on `b4`, but it can simply retreat `8. Bb3`

###### 8. Bb3 Be7

The only move that doesn't lose a whole pawn in the evaluation, because 
it stops `d4` from being as effective, and allows Black to castle.

###### 6. c3 b5

Ignoring the attacked knight for a moment, Black attacks our precious light
squared bishop. As pre usual with the `b5` attack we can retreat the bishop 
to `f1` and wait for the knight to move before capturing the pawn.

###### 7. Bf1 Nxd5 ; 8. cxd4 Qxg4 

Sneaky attack, still ignoring the knight and uncovering an attack on our knight.
However, Blacks pawns are hanging so White can just capture on `d4` and then 
capture that annoying pawn on `b5` with check.

###### 9. Bxb5+ Kd8 ; 10. O-O

Need to castle here as the queen is attacking `g2`.

###### 9. Bxb5+ Bd7 ; 10. Bxd7+ Kxd7 ; 11. O-O


##### 4. Ng5 d5 ; 5 exd5 Nxd5

This move you'll see a lot at the lower levels. White can respond by taking the
pawn on `f7` anyway: `6. Nxf7`.


##### 4. Ng5 Bc5

The Traxler counter-attack. Things are about to get sharp with Black ready to sacrifice 
the bishop on `f2` and then swoop in with the knight on `e4`. White should 
however still continue its plan of attack `f7` with `5. Nxf7`. Taking with 
the bishop would not that be that much weaker.

###### 5. Nxf7 Bxf7+

Black ignores the fork and delivers a check. White definitely should not take 
or all the initiative would go to Black (`6. Kxf7 Nxe4+ ; 7. Ke3 Qh4; 8. c3 Nxg3!`)
so `6. Kf1`

###### 6. Kf1 Qe7 

Pretty much forced, as is `7. Nxh8`. Black needs to retreat its bishop and
White can then play `8. Bf7+` to take castling rights away. A more complicated 
line is `7 ... d5` attacking White's bishop on `c4`.

###### 7. Nxh8 d5 ; 8 exd4 Nd4

This is looking dangerous for white. Pretty much the only move that doesn't
at least draw is a common idea when the knight gets pushed away by the `d5`
pawn: `9. d6`

###### 9. d6 Qxd6

Any other move would lose the bishop (or the queen of course). With the queen
temporarily out of the picture we can now try to rescue our knight: `10. Nf7`.
Black needs to be very careful: the queen is under attack, the bishop is
hanging, `c3` is coming, `e5` is under attack.

###### 10. Nf7 Qc5

The only move that doesn't drop 2 pawns in evaluation. Attacking the bishop 
and defending `e5`, getting ready to defend the bishop if the knight gets 
kicked away. White's reply is pretty much forced to keep the advantage: `11. d3`. 
Defending the bishop, defending the `e4` square and unleashing the bishop on `c1`.

##### 4. Ng5 Nxe4 ; 5 Bf7+ Ke7 

Black ignores the threat on f7, wins a pawn and attacks the knight. The best response 
for White is to take with the bishop in this case `5. Bf7+`. Note that taking the knight 
with `5. Nxe4` runs into a tactic `...d5`.

Black's `5 ...Ke7` is forced, after which White plays `d4`, attacking `e5` and defending 
the knight on `g5` using the bishop on `c1`.

###### 6. d4 h6

`h6` is the best move in this position for Black, kicking away the defender of
the bishop. At this point White has done enough damage to warant giving up the
bishop pair, and the tactic on `d5` no longer works so White can safely take the
knight `7. Nxe4`.

###### 7. Nxe4 Kxf7 

`Kxf7` is the only move that doesn't lose. `Qf3` looks tempting, but doesn't
achieve much as the king can just hide on `g8`, which wouldn't be too bad a
square for it. The pawn on `d4` is still hanging however, and we can gain
another tempo: `8. d5`. 

Black's knight has to move either up or down the board: `8 ...Ne7` or `8...Nd4`, 
although `8...Na5` isn't more terrible and might get played as well.

###### 8. d5 Nd4

Black tries to get some counterplay, but this ain't an outpost. White can play
`9.  c3` and give Black another choice. Seemingly equally valid options are `9.
Qd3` and `9. O-O`, but I feel it's good to keep the direct pressure on in this
case.

###### 9. c3 Nb5

The knight retreats and White has gained some space. Time to castle. `10. O-O`

###### 10. O-O Kg8

Black also works on king safety, but does block their rook in the process.

###### 9. c3 Qh4

The old trickster, attacking our knight on e4, which would even come with a
check when captured. Easily defended by `10. Ng3` though, but `10. Nbd2` even
develops a piece so should be preferred. Note that Black's horsy is still
hanging.

###### 10. Nbd2 Nf5

Black has to retreat their knight, but now we can pin it to the king: `11.
Qf3`.  The knight is lost now unless Black offers a queen trade, because we can
always play `g4` if Black defends it in another way.

###### 11. Qf3 Qf4 

###### 11. Qf3 d6 ; 12. g4 g6 ;  or  11. Qf3 g6 ; 12. g4 d6

White plays `12. g4` to attack the pinned knight, and Black tries to get some
compensation.

The engine move here is `13. h3`, `13. b3`, `13. c4`, and trailing `13. gxf5`,
as I guess there's no rush to capture the knight. I'm not sure what the point
of `h3` is.

###### 10. Nbd2 Nb5

This would have worked previously, but with queen on `h4` and the king on `f7`
Black is playing a dangerous game, and every effort trying to defend the knight
runs into a check on `d6` followed by taking the queen. For example: `11. Qa4
Nd3 12. Nxd3 cxd6 13.  Qxh4`. The only valid responses for black here are to 
move their king or queen, but the position is already pretty hopeless.

###### 8. d5 Ne7

###### 8. d5 Na5

###### 7. Nxe4 d5 ; 8. Bxd5 Qxd5 ; 9. Nbc3

###### 7. Nxe4 Nxd4

###### 6. d4 Nxd4

Poor move. Ignore the threats to win a pawn.

###### 6. d4 d5

Poor move. Creates some space for the king and awakens the bishop, but doesn't
deal with the threats.
