# Italian Game with 4 ...Nf6  5. d3 d6 (for White)

## 1. e4 e5

### 2. Nf3 Nc6

#### 3. Bc4 Bc5

##### 4. O-O Nf6

###### 5. d3 d6

Black also defends its centre pawn, but perhaps more importantly unleashes the
bishop on `c8`, which would find a nice home on `g4`.

The engine recommendation here is to play `6. a4` or `6. c3`. The idea behind
`6. c3` is that you're threatening to play `b4` and `d4` at some point.

The idea behind `a4` is less obvious, but might allow you to put your
bishop on `b5` and get into some tactics winning the rook if Black misplays.
It also makes space for the bishop to retreat in case Black plays his knight to 
`a5`.

However, to keep things simple I would normally play `6. h3` in this position.
The best recommendation for black after that is a move I don't think I've ever 
seen in any of my games (`6. h3 Na5`)
