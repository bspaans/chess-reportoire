# Italian Opening (for White)

## 1. e4 e5

### 2. Nf3 Nc6

#### 3. Bc4 Bc5

The Italian opening. Black also moves his bishop out of the way creating a 
symmetrical position. White can proceed by castling short. `4. O-O`. 

Some rules going forward: if Black plays `d6` we should play `h3` to avoid the
bishop pinning the knight to the queen. We should try and kick away the bishop
on `c5`, and close its diagonal or exchange it. Pawn break usually happens on
the `d` file. 

Variations:

* `4. O-O Nf6` [Italian game; main line](4_O_O_Nf6.md)
* `4. O-O d6` [Variation 1](4_O_O_d6.md)
* `4. O-O Qe7` 
* `4. O-O Qe7`
