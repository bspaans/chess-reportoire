# Italian Opening (for White)

## 1. e4 e5

### 2. Nf3 Nc6

#### 3. Bc4 Bc5

The Italian opening. Black also moves his bishop out of the way creating a 
symmetrical position. White can proceed by castling short. `4. O-O`. 

Some rules going forward: if Black plays `d6` we should play `h3` to avoid the
bishop pinning the knight to the queen. We should try and kick away the bishop
on `c5`, and close its diagonal or exchange it. Pawn break usually happens on
the `d` file. If Black 

##### 4. O-O Nf6

Black develops his knight, making room to castle and also attacking the pawn on
e4. White defends with `5. d3`

###### 5. d3 d6

Black also defends its centre pawn, but perhaps more importantly unleashes the
bishop on `c8`, which would find a nice home on `g4`.

The engine recommendation here is to play `6. a4` or `6. c3`. The idea behind
`6. c3` is that you're threatening to play `b4` and `d4` at some point.

The idea behind `a4` is less obvious, but might allow you to put your
bishop on `b5` and get into some tactics winning the rook if Black misplays.
It also makes space for the bishop to retreat in case Black plays his knight to 
`a5`.

However, to keep things simple I would normally play `6. h3` in this position.
The best recommendation for black after that is a move I don't think I've ever 
seen in any of my games (`6. h3 Na5`)

##### 4. O-O d6

White doesn't want to allow the bishop to pin the knight to the queen at `g4`,
so just plays `h3`.
