# The Sicilian Defense (for White)

## 1. e4 c5

The Sicilian defense. Like many `e4` players I don't particularly enjoy 
facing the Sicilian so I try to play anti-Sicilians.

### 2. d4 cxd4

The Smith-Morra gambit. Served me well getting to 1600 in blitz, but may need
to reevaluate this choice going forward.

#### 3. c3 dxc3

Offering Black yet another pawn. We want to open those files and then take 
back with the knight.

##### 4. Nxc3 (Nc6, d6, e6)

White has taken the pawn, developed a piece, and has two semi-open files to
play with. The plan going forward is to get castled by developing `Nf3` and
`Bc4`, then putting the queen on `e2`, the rook `fd1` and the bishop on `f4`,
after which we can build up some serious pressure on the `e5` square and, by
extension, the `d6` square.

Black usually plays the move `d6`, `e6`, `Nc6` and `Nf6`. `a6` can be good as
well, as it stops the knight from coming into the queen side.

###### 5. Nf3 (Nc6, d6, e6) ; 6. Bc4 (Nc6, d6, e6) 

White is ready to castle here and Black is still looking very passive. After
`7. O-O` the real test of the Smith-Morra gambit starts, as the question is put
to Black: how are you gonna develop your pieces? But at the same time White has
to show that all the pawn sacs were worth it. 

###### 7. O-O a6

Black played another pawn move, but the position is still pretty even. White 
can continue with their usual plan: `8. Qe2`.

###### 8. Qe2 Be7 

Black stops the x-ray on the queen and defends the knight (so that `b6` can be
played at some point?). Like usual when `Be7` is playing in the Smith-Morra, we can 
change the move order a bit and play `9. Bf4`.

###### 8. Qe2 Na5 

Bad line, but seen this pop up in real games. White can just ignore this as the
bishop is defended and there are some interesting tactics lurking down the
line. Also Black is still barely developed so there would be good compensation.
`9. Rd1`, claming the semi-open `d` file.

###### 9. Rd1 Nxc3

Another bad move, but also seen in real games. White's plan is to play `Qxc3`
and `Bf4`.  If the queen moves to `b8` there are some fun tactics with pushing
`e5` and sacking a knight on `d5` if black pushes their pawn. After `e6` that
would hang Black's queen.


###### 7. O-O Be7

In this line Black is preventing some tactics on the `d` file, but has also
blocked one of the defenders of `d6`, so we can develop our bishop with `8.
Bf4`, instead of playing for tricks with `Qe2` and `Rfd1`.

###### 8. Bf4 Qb8

Apparently the best option for Black, but hard to find in a real game. After this 
move we can continue with our usual development plan. `9. Qe2`

###### 8. Bf4 e4

It seems logical to want to kick the bishop away, but this also creates a big
weakness in Black's position. Especially `f7` has now become a target, so `9.
Qb3`. If the bishop gets captured, Black gets mated.

###### 7. O-O Nf6

###### 7. O-O h6

This prevents the bishop and knight from coming to `g5`, but otherwise seems 
very passive. Black still has issues on the `d` file to solve, so `8. Qe2`


### 2. Nc3

Another anti-Sicilian.

### 2. Nf3

Alright, let's play a Sicilian then.
