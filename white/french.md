# The French Defense (for White)

## 1. e4 e6

It's the French

### 2. d4 d5

#### 3. exd5 exd5

We play `c4` in reply. Not the optimal move (which is Nf3, boring), but this
often confuses Black and keeps challenging the center. There's only one move
for Black (Nf6) that keeps the advantage. The plan for White is to get `Nf3` 
in to challenge the center once more, and eventually take on `d5` or on `c4` 
with the bishop, once the pressure becomes too much for Black. 

#### 3. exd5 Qxd5 ; 4. Be3 ... ; 5; Nf3

If Black takes with the queen then play bishop to `e3` before moving the
knight, so that there is no `Qe4+`.

##### 4. c4 Nf6

The best response for black. White also develops their knight with `Nc3`.

###### 5. Nc3 dxc4

Best response for black. They have to resolve the tension, because `d5` was up
for grabs. White takes back with the bishop.

###### 6. Bxc4 Qxd4

Black wins back a pawn and threatens to take the bishop, also offering to
exchange queens, but everything is defended with `7. Qe2+`.

###### 7. Qe2+

##### 4. c4 Bb4+

##### 4. c4 Be6

White plays the familiar `Nc3`.

###### 5. Nc3

##### 4. c4 c6 

White plays the familiar `Nc3`.

###### 5. Nc3
