# The Petrov or Russian Defense (for White)

Reached after `1. e4 e5  2. Nf3 Nf6`. White takes the pawn on `e5` with `3.
Nxe5`. Opening gambits are there to be accepted.

#### 3. Nxe5 d6 

Black challenges the knight. White just moves it back whence it came.

##### 4. Nf3 Nxe4

Only good move. White plays `d4` in this position. Opening up the bishop and
grabbing space in the centre. Black gets a number of valid responses here.

###### 5. d4 d5 

Black solidifies its knight, but White should challenge anyway with `6. Bd3`.
Black gets a number of valid responses here, again.

###### 6. Bd3 Bd6

Black gets ready to castle and takes charge of some nice diagonals. White doesn't 
waste a tempo by castling themselves.

###### 7. O-O O-O

With both players castled, White can make an attempt at controlling the centre
with `8. c4`.

###### 8. c4 c6

The `d5` pawn is under attack, but it's defending the knight. The most straight 
forward way to defend is `c6`. White can put more pressure on `d5` by playing 
`Nc3`, and basically provoking Black to move its knight on `e4` again.

###### 9. Nc3 Nxc3

Horsies are exchanged with `10. bxc3`.

###### 10. bxc3 dxc3 ; 11. Bxc3

###### 8. c4 Nf6

###### 8. c4 Be6

###### 6. Bd3 Bb4+

Black gives a check, but it seems to not be doing much.

###### 6. Bd3 Be7

###### 6. Bd3 Nc6

Black challenges the pawn on `d4`. Not a problem now, but the knight on `f3`
might get pinned soon.

###### 5. d4 Be7

###### 5. d4 Nc6

###### 5. d4 Nf6

#### 3. Nxe5 Nxe4

White plays `4. Qe2`

##### 4. Qe2
